## Introduction
StudyNotion aims to provide a seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education more accessible and engaging. Additionally, the platform serves as a hub for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners across the globe.

In the following sections, we will cover the technical details of the platform, including the system architecture, API design, installation, usage instructions, and potential future enhancements.



## System Architecture
The StudyNotion EdTech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.



## Front-end
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, crucial for providing an engaging learning experience to students. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.

**Front-end Tools and Libraries**
- ReactJS: For building user interfaces.
- CSS and Tailwind CSS: For styling.
- Redux: For state management.

## Back-end

The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs for the front end to consume. These APIs include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

**Back-end Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools**:

- **Node.js**: Used as the primary framework for the back end.
- **Express.js**: Used as a web application framework, providing a range of features and tools for building web applications.
- **MongoDB**: Used as the primary database, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user credentials.
- **Bcrypt:** Used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.
- **Mongoose**: Used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript.

## Data Models
- **Student Schema**: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each student.
- **Instructor Schema**: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each instructor.
- **Course Schema**: Includes fields such as course name, description, instructor details, and media content.
